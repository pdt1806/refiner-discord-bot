## About Refiner

In order for [Discord Status as Image](https://disi.bennynguyen.dev/) to work, users' data need to be obtained by someone powerful, and Refiner is the one who can do that!

Why Refiner? I mean, why not? (ï¿£ â–½ ï¿£)ãƒŽ She is the Greatest Mage of All Time after all ðŸª„

## Why is she called Refiner?

## "Can I use this bot?"

Unfortunately, no. This bot is only for personal use (she's mine), and I don't have any plan to make it public (no ntr here). However, you can use Refiner as a reference to make your own bot, although she only has 1 spell (ï¿£ â–½ ï¿£\*)ã‚ž (and some hidden spells).
